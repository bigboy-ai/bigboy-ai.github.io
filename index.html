 <strong> Hello! </strong> My name is Aiden and this is about my website. My websites content consist of having about 6 pages,<br>
  first the introduction, then the 5 cities. Each pages have at least one city with 6 popular places.<br><br>

 The purpose of my website and the benefits for using it is time management.<br> People such as families, tourist,
  or people visiting family members in Japan would make a list of how they are going to spend their holiday,<br> but Japan has so many places
 to visit, and because of that, some of them may miss out on the one's they would really enjoy.<br>
 <br>
  However, this website saves your time by giving you a list of cities links that leads you to 6 areas that are very famous( Reviews from google),<br> there would also be collaspsible at the back on every popular places stated and once clicked,
  would show a brief description about it.<br> In addition, I also added a menu at the other 5 pages so that navigation is easy to move around.<br> <br>
  <em>If you are not sure what to do? Check out the video on the right for a demonstration </em> <br>
